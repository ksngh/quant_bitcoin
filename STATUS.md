# Project Status

# Current Phase

Phase 53: Adam And Eve Risk / Exit Plan Implementation

# Current Step

Task 053 Adam And Eve Risk / Exit Plan implemented and verified.

# Current Goal

Provide the Adam And Eve pattern-specific risk/exit planner using the shared Task 047 contract.

# Current Active Task

Task 053 Adam And Eve Risk / Exit Plan implementation.

# Last Completed Step

Task 053: Adam And Eve Risk / Exit Plan implementation.

Implemented an Adam And Eve-specific risk/exit planner that consumes existing bullish Adam And Eve events and the shared Task 047 contract. The planner supports practical Eve-low hard stops, optional wider Adam/Eve low stop mode, measured targets from neckline plus pattern height, neckline soft-exit metadata, optional structure targets, and explicit rejection of unsupported inverse directions. Verified with `pytest tests/patterns/test_adam_and_eve_risk_exit.py` and `pytest`.

Previous completed step: Task 052 Diamond Risk / Exit Plan implementation.

# Next Step

Recommended next task: owner review of the completed Task 053 Adam And Eve planner, then assign Task 054 Pattern Exit Simulation Integration for implementation. Local Docker Compose runtime startup verification for Task 014/018 remains deferred to a Docker-capable developer environment.

# Parallel Work Status

Parallel work is not currently recommended.

Reason:
Task 047 completed the shared pattern risk/exit contract and Tasks 048-053 completed the dependent pattern planners. Task 054 integrates planner outputs into exit simulation and should be assigned as the next shared integration task rather than parallelized.

# Open Questions

- Has the project owner explicitly approved live trading and real order execution?
- What credential policy should be used for API keys and secrets?
- Should future live trading use Binance testnet/sandbox first?
- What real-order endpoints, if any, are allowed?
- What kill-switch or disable mechanism is required?
- Task 024 decided the concrete PostgreSQL command-management path: `db/init/001_schema.sql` is the source-of-truth first-start schema DDL, `db/changes/` is reserved for future existing-database state-change SQL, repository initialization executes managed command files, and runtime persistence DML remains application-owned.
- Task 025 defines the indicator document intake process. Future owner-provided indicator documents should be saved under `tasks/indicators/<INDICATOR_KEY>.md`, and concrete indicator code must wait for an explicit indicator-specific implementation task. Pattern definition documents may be saved under `tasks/patterns/` when explicitly assigned by the owner.
- Tasks 027-033 define planned implementation tasks for the remaining indicator/filter modules. Task 028 Pivot High / Pivot Low, Task 029 Swing Structure, Task 030 ATR, Task 031 Volume Ratio, Task 032 Support / Resistance Zone, and Task 033 Displacement Candle have deterministic implementations pending review. Task 034 has been restored as the Trendline Break Pattern mechanical-definition task, Task 035 has been restored as the Order Block Pattern mechanical-definition task, Task 036 has been restored as the Fair Value Gap Pattern mechanical-definition task, Task 037 has been created as the Cup and Handle Pattern mechanical-definition task, Task 038 has been created as the Diamond Pattern mechanical-definition task and reviewed by the owner, and Task 039 has been created as the Adam and Eve Pattern mechanical-definition task and updated from the owner-provided final document. The Trendline Break, Order Block, Fair Value Gap, Cup and Handle, Diamond, and Adam and Eve patterns are documented as mechanical definitions. Task 040 implemented the first pattern detection engine batch focused on Fair Value Gap detection. Task 041 implemented the next pattern detection engine batch focused on Trendline Break detection. Task 042 implemented the next pattern detection engine batch focused on Order Block detection. Task 043 implemented the next pattern detection engine batch focused on Cup and Handle detection. Task 044 implemented the next pattern detection engine batch focused on Diamond Pattern detection. Task 045 implemented the next pattern detection engine batch focused on Adam and Eve Pattern detection. Task 046 completed the documentation-only review assignment for current indicator structure, pattern algorithms, and indicator/pattern class usage. Task 047 now defines the required first implementation step for a shared pattern risk/exit contract. Tasks 048-053 define dependent pattern-specific stop-loss/take-profit planner tasks for Trendline Break, Order Block, Fair Value Gap, Cup and Handle, Diamond, and Adam and Eve. Task 054 defines a later exit-simulation integration task. Liquidity and bid-ask spread filters remain unavailable as reusable modules, so future pattern detectors and risk/exit planners must handle those filters explicitly rather than silently approximating them.
- Docker is not installed in the current cloud environment. Local PostgreSQL and WebSocket ingestor container startup are intentionally skipped here and remain optional local developer verification.

# Blockers

- Live trading implementation is blocked until explicit human approval, credential policy, sandbox/testnet policy, real-order endpoint allowlist, kill-switch design, and safety tests are documented.

# Rules for Next Codex Task

- Read `AGENTS.md` before working.
- Read this `STATUS.md` before starting implementation tasks.
- Use `docs/10_CODEX_COMMAND_GUIDE.md` for consistent command handling and reusable prompt formats.
- Read the assigned task file before coding.
- Do not implement application code unless the assigned task explicitly requires it.
- Do not create trading logic unless the assigned task explicitly requires it.
- Do not mark a phase or step complete unless acceptance criteria and verification are satisfied.
- Update this file when the project phase, step, goal, active task, blocker, open question, or completion state changes.

# Status Update Rule

Codex must update `STATUS.md` whenever project state changes. If state is uncertain, Codex must leave the item open and record the uncertainty under Open Questions or Blockers.
