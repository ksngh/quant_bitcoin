# Project Status

# Current Phase

Phase 58: Pattern Backtest All Implemented Pattern Selection Task Definition

# Current Step

Task 058 pattern backtest all implemented pattern selection task document created; awaiting owner review or implementation assignment.

# Current Goal

Define the implementation task for extending the existing Task 057 pattern-selection seam so the pattern backtest CLI/backtest workflow can select every safely wireable already-implemented detector plus risk/exit planner pair while preserving the Fair Value Gap default and historical-simulation safety boundary.

# Current Active Task

Task 058 task document creation complete. No application code has been implemented for additional pattern selection in this step.

# Last Completed Step

Task 058: Pattern Backtest All Implemented Pattern Selection task document creation.

Created `tasks/058_PATTERN_BACKTEST_ALL_IMPLEMENTED_PATTERN_SELECTION.md` to define future implementation work for expanding `quant-bitcoin-pattern-backtest --pattern` support to every safely wireable already-implemented pattern detector and risk/exit planner pair, keeping `FAIR_VALUE_GAP` as the default, preserving stable JSON pattern identifiers and deterministic strategy names, rejecting unsupported selections before provider/backtest execution, updating README/status documentation during implementation, and verifying no live trading, order execution, API-key, `.env`, schema, scheduler, dashboard, Docker, or persistence behavior is introduced.

Previous completed step: Task 057 Pattern Backtest CLI clarity and pattern selection implementation.

Implemented explicit Fair Value Gap wording for `quant-bitcoin-pattern-backtest --help`, changed default JSON strategy metadata to `FAIR_VALUE_GAP_PATTERN_STRATEGY`, added a tested `--pattern FAIR_VALUE_GAP` selection seam with validation that rejects unsupported patterns before provider/backtest execution, and documented a safe README usage example. Verified targeted pattern backtest/CLI tests, full `pytest`, CLI `--help`, and `git diff --check`.

Previous completed step: Task 057 task document creation.

Created `tasks/057_PATTERN_BACKTEST_CLI_CLARITY_AND_PATTERN_SELECTION.md` to define future implementation work for clearer Fair Value Gap default CLI description/help text, `FAIR_VALUE_GAP_PATTERN_STRATEGY` JSON output naming, README usage documentation, and a tested pattern-selection seam for additional supported pattern backtests while preserving the no-live-trading safety boundary.

Previous completed step before Task 057: Task 056 Pattern PostgreSQL Backtest CLI implementation.

Implemented `quant-bitcoin-pattern-backtest` as a project script entrypoint backed by `quant_bitcoin/backtesting/pattern_postgres_runner_cli.py`. The CLI loads completed `1m` candles through `PostgresCandleDataProvider`, rejects non-`1m` intervals, delegates simulation to the Task 055 pattern strategy backtest workflow, and prints a deterministic JSON summary. Added fake-backed CLI wiring, help, empty-candle, entrypoint-registration, reuse-contract, and safety tests in `tests/backtesting/test_pattern_postgres_runner_cli.py`. Verified with targeted CLI tests, `python -m quant_bitcoin.backtesting.pattern_postgres_runner_cli --help`, and the full `pytest` suite. Direct `quant-bitcoin-pattern-backtest --help` could not be executed in this environment before package installation because the script was not installed; editable installation was blocked by package build dependency availability/network restrictions. The script registration is verified in `pyproject.toml`.

# Next Step

Recommended next task: owner review of Task 058, then assign `tasks/058_PATTERN_BACKTEST_ALL_IMPLEMENTED_PATTERN_SELECTION.md` for implementation if the project owner wants to wire additional already-implemented pattern detector/risk-exit pairs into the existing pattern-selection registry. Local Docker Compose runtime startup verification for Task 014/018 remains deferred to a Docker-capable developer environment.

# Parallel Work Status

Parallel work is not currently recommended.

Reason:
Task 058 is a shared CLI/backtest registry implementation task; no active parallel work is recommended until owner review assigns implementation and confirms whether any independent leaf tasks exist.

# Open Questions

- Has the project owner explicitly approved live trading and real order execution?
- What credential policy should be used for API keys and secrets?
- Should future live trading use Binance testnet/sandbox first?
- What real-order endpoints, if any, are allowed?
- What kill-switch or disable mechanism is required?
- Task 024 decided the concrete PostgreSQL command-management path: `db/init/001_schema.sql` is the source-of-truth first-start schema DDL, `db/changes/` is reserved for future existing-database state-change SQL, repository initialization executes managed command files, and runtime persistence DML remains application-owned.
- Task 025 defines the indicator document intake process. Future owner-provided indicator documents should be saved under `tasks/indicators/<INDICATOR_KEY>.md`, and concrete indicator code must wait for an explicit indicator-specific implementation task. Pattern definition documents may be saved under `tasks/patterns/` when explicitly assigned by the owner.
- Tasks 027-033 define planned implementation tasks for the remaining indicator/filter modules. Task 028 Pivot High / Pivot Low, Task 029 Swing Structure, Task 030 ATR, Task 031 Volume Ratio, Task 032 Support / Resistance Zone, and Task 033 Displacement Candle have deterministic implementations pending review. Task 034 has been restored as the Trendline Break Pattern mechanical-definition task, Task 035 has been restored as the Order Block Pattern mechanical-definition task, Task 036 has been restored as the Fair Value Gap Pattern mechanical-definition task, Task 037 has been created as the Cup and Handle Pattern mechanical-definition task, Task 038 has been created as the Diamond Pattern mechanical-definition task and reviewed by the owner, and Task 039 has been created as the Adam and Eve Pattern mechanical-definition task and updated from the owner-provided final document. The Trendline Break, Order Block, Fair Value Gap, Cup and Handle, Diamond, and Adam and Eve patterns are documented as mechanical definitions. Task 040 implemented the first pattern detection engine batch focused on Fair Value Gap detection. Task 041 implemented the next pattern detection engine batch focused on Trendline Break detection. Task 042 implemented the next pattern detection engine batch focused on Order Block detection. Task 043 implemented the next pattern detection engine batch focused on Cup and Handle detection. Task 044 implemented the next pattern detection engine batch focused on Diamond Pattern detection. Task 045 implemented the next pattern detection engine batch focused on Adam and Eve Pattern detection. Task 046 completed the documentation-only review assignment for current indicator structure, pattern algorithms, and indicator/pattern class usage. Task 047 now defines the required first implementation step for a shared pattern risk/exit contract. Tasks 048-053 define dependent pattern-specific stop-loss/take-profit planner tasks for Trendline Break, Order Block, Fair Value Gap, Cup and Handle, Diamond, and Adam and Eve. Task 054 completed exit-simulation integration. Task 055 completed the first pattern strategy backtest integration for Fair Value Gap entries, valid FVG risk/exit plans, duplicate event prevention, and Task 054 exit simulation. Task 056 implemented a `quant-bitcoin-pattern-backtest` CLI that loads PostgreSQL-backed `1m` candles through the existing provider and reuses the Task 055 pattern strategy backtest without adding live trading, order execution, scheduler, dashboard, or schema-redesign behavior. Task 057 clarified the CLI as the default Fair Value Gap pattern strategy backtest, changed default JSON strategy metadata to `FAIR_VALUE_GAP_PATTERN_STRATEGY`, documented safe README usage, and added the first tested FVG-only `--pattern FAIR_VALUE_GAP` selection seam while rejecting unsupported patterns before execution. Task 058 defines the next implementation task for expanding that seam to every safely wireable already-implemented detector plus risk/exit planner pair while keeping `FAIR_VALUE_GAP` as the default and preserving safety boundaries. The Task 055 first-batch assumptions are: Fair Value Gap only by default, one simulated open position at a time, entry on the pattern confirmation candle, exit evaluation starts on the next completed candle, and same-candle eligible events are ordered by pattern type, direction, then event id. Liquidity and bid-ask spread filters remain unavailable as reusable modules, so future pattern detectors and risk/exit planners must handle those filters explicitly rather than silently approximating them.
- Docker is not installed in the current cloud environment. Local PostgreSQL and WebSocket ingestor container startup are intentionally skipped here and remain optional local developer verification.

# Blockers

- Live trading implementation is blocked until explicit human approval, credential policy, sandbox/testnet policy, real-order endpoint allowlist, kill-switch design, and safety tests are documented.

# Rules for Next Codex Task

- Read `AGENTS.md` before working.
- Read this `STATUS.md` before starting implementation tasks.
- Use `docs/10_CODEX_COMMAND_GUIDE.md` for consistent command handling and reusable prompt formats.
- Read the assigned task file before coding.
- Do not implement application code unless the assigned task explicitly requires it.
- Do not create trading logic unless the assigned task explicitly requires it.
- Do not mark a phase or step complete unless acceptance criteria and verification are satisfied.
- Update this file when the project phase, step, goal, active task, blocker, open question, or completion state changes.

# Status Update Rule

Codex must update `STATUS.md` whenever project state changes. If state is uncertain, Codex must leave the item open and record the uncertainty under Open Questions or Blockers.
