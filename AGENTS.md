# Project

This is a Python Bitcoin quantitative trading project.

The project starts small and evolves gradually. The current focus is candle data, technical-analysis strategies, basic backtesting, and paper trading. Live trading and risk management are later phases.

# Current Scope

- project setup
- market data contract
- CSV/local data provider
- RSI strategy
- basic backtest
- paper trader
- Binance historical candle downloader later

# Out of Scope by Default

Codex must not implement the following unless an assigned future task explicitly requests them:

- live trading
- real Binance order execution
- risk management
- dashboard
- database
- scheduler
- FastAPI
- Streamlit
- Docker
- machine learning
- futures
- leverage
- portfolio optimization

# Working Rules

- Read `AGENTS.md` before working.
- Read relevant docs before working.
- Read the assigned task file before coding.
- For consistent command handling and reusable prompt formats, follow `docs/10_CODEX_COMMAND_GUIDE.md`.
- Do not proceed with implementation or documentation changes unless a specific task document is assigned.
- If no task document is assigned, stop and ask the project owner to assign or create a task, even if the user prompt is written as a direct command.
- If the requirement is unclear, extract roles and write assumptions before implementation.
- Make small, incremental changes.
- Do not expand scope beyond the assigned task.
- Do not modify unrelated files.
- Add or update tests when implementation tasks are performed later.
- Run verification commands when possible.
- Summarize changed files, behavior added, tests run, and known limitations.

# Project Status Tracking

- Codex must read `STATUS.md` before starting implementation tasks.
- Codex must use `STATUS.md` as the current project-state ledger for phase, step, active task, blockers, open questions, and parallel work status.
- Codex must update `STATUS.md` when project state changes.
- Codex must not mark phases, steps, or checklist items complete unless acceptance criteria and verification are satisfied.
- If completion is uncertain, Codex must leave the item open and record the uncertainty in `STATUS.md`.

# Requirement-to-Implementation Workflow

Raw requirement
-> Clean requirement
-> Role extraction
-> Responsibility boundary check
-> Task document
-> Test plan
-> Implementation
-> Codex self-review
-> PR review
-> Decision/doc update if needed

# Parallel Work Rule

- Codex may use parallelism only for independent leaf tasks.
- Codex must not parallelize shared contract changes.
- Codex must not rename or redesign public interfaces during a parallel batch.
- If a shared contract change seems necessary, Codex must stop and report it instead of silently changing it.

Safe parallel examples:

- CSV provider
- RSI strategy
- PaperTrader
- isolated documentation review

Unsafe parallel examples:

- market data contract changes
- signal contract changes
- base strategy interface changes
- backtest result model changes
- project package layout changes

# Safety Rules

- Do not hardcode API keys.
- Do not commit `.env` files.
- Do not place real orders unless a future task explicitly asks for real order execution.
- Paper trading must never call real exchange order APIs.
- Binance candle downloading is allowed only for data collection, not order execution.
- Strategy code must never call exchange APIs.
- Tests must not call real exchange order endpoints.
- Do not create `ENABLE_LIVE_TRADING=true` defaults.

# Codex Self-Review Requirement

Before finishing any implementation task, Codex must perform a self-review using `reviews/CODEX_SELF_REVIEW.md`.

Codex must check:

- Did I implement only the assigned task?
- Did I modify unrelated files?
- Did I violate role ownership?
- Did I violate architecture boundaries?
- Did I add unnecessary abstractions?
- Did I add or update tests?
- Did I run verification commands?
- Did I hardcode secrets?
- Did I accidentally add real trading behavior?
- Did I accidentally call exchange order APIs?
- Did I update docs or decisions if behavior changed?

Codex must include a self-review summary before completing the task.

# Pull Request Review Requirement

When a pull request is opened, Codex review should check:

- scope expansion
- requirement mismatch
- missing tests
- architecture boundary violations
- role ownership violations
- data contract violations
- hardcoded secrets
- unsafe live trading behavior
- accidental exchange order calls
- unnecessary abstractions
- documentation updates when behavior changed

For trading-related changes, review must be strict around:

- API keys
- `.env` files
- live order execution
- exchange order endpoints
- paper trading accidentally using live clients
- Binance data downloader accidentally using order endpoints

# Completion Rules

Every implementation task must end with:

- files changed
- implementation summary
- tests added or updated
- tests run
- Codex self-review result
- known limitations
- recommended next task
